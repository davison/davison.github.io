title: Multi Room Audio
---

Before Christmas last year, I started playing around with some tech that I hoped would eventually become a multi-room audio system. Although I got a bit distracted then with some smart-home stuff (which I might write about), I eventually came back to the original goal of listening to music and radio in various places around the house.

Ambitions for the project were as follows:

1. Use kit I already had, as far as possible
1. Make it possible to play different music or streams in each location, OR synchronise any or all of the locations so that they all played the same music in perfect lagless sync
1. Control all of it from any of our phones
1. Make it future expandable
1. Do it all at a fraction of the cost of Sonos
