Decided to spruce up the home office and do something about the growing cityscape of wires and gadgets under the desk. A story in pictures.

It's been a long time coming (13 years since we moved in to the house) and things were looking a bit desparate..

![skirting]({{ site.url }}/public/images/office/006.jpeg)
![carpet]({{ site.url }}/public/images/office/007.jpeg)

Clear out, radiator off, detached skirting board removed, cleaned & reattached, and carpet/underlay gone..

Right, while someone else does some painting, time to look at shelving and cabling the (completely OTT) cabinet..

How's the painting going..? Nice job, superhuman effort by Lisa to get all the woodwork done with 2 coats of eggshell and no help. Also all the edging on the walls and several of the coats of the terracota feature wall. Bethan painted covings and kept us all supplied with drinks!

Now the carpet tiles (forgot to take some snaps of the work in progress :( ) which took Ben and I about 6 long hours of planning, dry-laying, cutting, and sticking down. Tidy result though, we're both pleased with that.

We can bring the cabinet in now (yay! Internet back on!!) and add the UPS, NAS and power cabling. Then add the non-rackable kit to the shelves, plug in and tidy up.

Shelf (one not put up yet due to some missing screws), desk and lights. The shelves and desk were custom made and are created from reclaimed scaffolding boards by Paul Swindell of [Chronology Furniture](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/ChronologyStore). I love the industrial look to it all.

Hard work for a Bank Holiday weekend project, but thanks to the whole family it's looking absolutely brilliant!
