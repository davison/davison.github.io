## Me

I'm older than I wish I was and younger than I hope to be and am lucky to have an amazing wife and 3 "kids". When I'm not messing around with computers, my life as a [SWFC](https://www.swfc.co.uk) fan is permanently painful. I do play a bit of chess (around 1900 ELO / 160 BCF at rapid or standard tc) but only online, I haven't played OTB for many years. I have random qualifications as a football coach, cricket umpire and English (as a foreign language) teacher. 

I'm a fan of digital rights and individual privacy, supporting [Tor Project](https://torproject.org), [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/) and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) with regular donations.
