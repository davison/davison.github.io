## Me

I'm older than I wish I was and younger than I hope to be. My life's shortened by being a [SWFC](https://www.swfc.co.uk) fan, made meaningful by my wife and family, and defined mostly by football, beer and computers. 

I have random qualifications as a football coach, cricket umpire and English (as a foreign language) teacher. I'm a fan of digital rights and individual privacy, supporting [Tor Project](https://torproject.org), [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/) and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)

Work related stuff you can see at [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.work }}).


## Projects

I work on a couple of things for the [football club](https://www.stbgfc.co.uk) that 
my son plays for.

* [the site itself](https://github.com/STBGFC/footy) - it's old now, and using obsolete tech (an old version of grails). We're looking to outsource to one of the companies that does this stuff, but still finding it hard to locate a system that does all the things this one does  
* [Tournament App](https://github.com/STBGFC/tournament-app) is what we use to manage the huge club tournaments we operate (often >300 teams and >900 matches played over a weekend). Originally written in AngularJS when that was still new, and mostly as a way for me to learn the MEAN stack of technologies. I'm trying to rewrite it now using [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
* [leagusort](https://github.com/davison/leaguesort). Calling it a project is something of a stretch. It's about 30 lines of badly written NodeJS that the tournament app uses, but I created it as an NPM module to learn how to work with NPM.
* A bunch of work related stuff that we hope to be able to open source soon and add to the rather lightweight list of things we have done so far at [Orbit Tech](https://github.com/orbit-tech)


## This Site

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using a modified [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template
* Developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/davison/davison.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited in a combination of [ViM](https://www.vim.org/) and [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* ... on Linux. Obviously.
